## FAQ

**Why does it use React to teach about state?** Nowadays, state management is often used in modern applications. These applications are built based on technologies such as React, Angular, and Vue. To teach about state management, it makes sense to apply it in a real-world context such as React. I picked React because it has only a slim API and a good learning curve. It is only the view layer with local state management. You can learn about it in my other book: [the Road to learn React](https://www.robinwieruch.de/the-road-to-learn-react/). However, you don't need to apply your learnings about state management in React. You can use these learnings in your Angular, Vue or React Native applications.

**What is the ratio between learning Redux and MobX?** Even though MobX is the most popular alternative to Redux, this book will put much emphasis on Redux than MobX. However, in the future, I want to extend the contents and adjust the chapters depending on the popularities.

**How to get updates?** I have two channels where I share updates about my content. You can either [subscribe to updates by email](https://www.getrevue.co/profile/rwieruch) or [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rwieruch). Regardless of the channel, my objective is only to share qualitative content. You will never receive any spam. Once you receive a notification that the book has changed, you can download the new version of it.

**How to get access to the source code projects and screencasts series?** If you have bought one of the extended packages that give you access to the source code projects, screencast series or any other addon, you should find these on your [course dashboard](https://roadtoreact.com/my-courses). If you have bought the course somewhere else than on [the official Road to React](https://roadtoreact.com) course platform, you need to create an account on the platform, go to the Admin page and contact me using one of the email templates so that I can enroll you to the course. If you haven't bought extended packages, you can reach out any time to upgrade your content to access the source code projects and screencast series.

**How can I get help while reading the book?** The book has a [Slack Group](https://slack-the-road-to-learn-react.wieruch.com/) for the readers. You can join the channel to get help or to help others. After all, helping others can internalize your learnings as well. If there is no one out to help, you can always reach out to me.

**Is there any troubleshoot area?** If you run into problems, please join the Slack Group. You can also have a look into the [open issues on GitHub](https://github.com/rwieruch/taming-the-state-in-react/issues) for the book. Perhaps your problem was already mentioned, and there is a solution to it. If it is a new problem, don't hesitate to open a new issue where you can explain your problem, provide a screenshot, and other required details (e.g., book page, node version). After all, I incorporate all fixes in the next editions of the book.

**What should I do when I cannot afford to pay for the course?** If you cannot afford the course but still want to learn the topic, you can reach out to me. It could be that you are a student or the course is too expensive in your country. Besides, I want to support any cause to improve the diversity in our culture of developers. If you belong to a minority or are in an organization that supports diversity, please reach out to me.

**Can I help to improve the content?** Yes, I would love to hear your feedback. You can simply open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/rwieruch/taming-the-state-in-react). These can be technical improvements or the written word improvements. I am not a native speaker that's why any help will be appreciated. You can open pull requests on the GitHub page as well.

**How to support the project?** If you believe in the content that I create, you can [support me](https://www.robinwieruch.de/about/). Moreover, I would be grateful if you spread the word about this book after you read and enjoy it. Furthermore, I would love to have you as my [Patron on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/rwieruch).

**Is there a money back guarantee?** Yes, there is a 100% money back guarantee for two months if you think it's not a good fit. Please reach out to me to get a refund.

**What's your motivation behind the book?** I want to teach about this topic consistently. There is a lot of materials online that doesn't receive any updates or only explains a small part of a topic. When learning something new, people struggle to find consistent and up-to-date resources to learn from. I want to give you this consistent and up-to-date learning experience. In addition, I hope I can support minorities with my projects by giving them the content for free or by [having other impacts](https://www.robinwieruch.de/giving-back-by-learning-react/). Besides, in the recent time, I found myself fulfilled when teaching others about programming. It's a meaningful activity for me that I prefer over any other 9 to 5 job at any company. That's why I hope to continue pursuing this path.

**Is there a call to action?** Yes. I want you to take a moment to think about a person who would be a good match for learning Redux. The person could have shown the interest already, could be in the middle of learning Redux or might not yet be aware of Redux. Reach out to that person and share the book. It would mean a lot to me. The book is intended to be given to others.
