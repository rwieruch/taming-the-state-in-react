## Requirements

What are the requirements for reading this book? First of all, you should be familiar with web development basics. You should be familiar with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Perhaps you should also familiarize yourself with the term [API](https://www.robinwieruch.de/what-is-an-api-javascript/) because you will use it in this book. Besides, I encourage you to join the official [Slack Group](https://slack-the-road-to-learn-react.wieruch.com/) for the book to get help or to help others.

### React

The book uses React Library for teaching modern state management. It is a perfect choice for demonstrating and learning state management in modern applications. React is only a view layer, so, it is up to you to decide how to deal with the state in your application. The state management layer is exchangeable.

Being a React developer is not a prerequisite for learning state management in modern applications. If you are using other frameworks, such as Angular, or library, such as Vue, everything about state management taught in this book can still be applied in your applications.

Moreover, since the book uses React for the sake of teaching state management in a proper context, if you are not familiar with React or need to have a refresher on the topic, I encourage you to read the precedent book: [The Road to learn React](https://www.robinwieruch.de/the-road-to-learn-react/). It is free and should enable everyone to learn React. However, if you wish, you can pay to support the project.

Even though the Road to learn React is free, people who lack this knowledge had no access to these resources in the first place. Understanding the English language is a must to be able to access and understand the resources. The Road to learn React attempts [to support education in the developing world](https://www.robinwieruch.de/giving-back-by-learning-react/) on an occasional basis, but it is a tough undertaking since the book itself is pay what you want.

Also, the Road to learn React teaches you to make the transition from JavaScript ES5 to JavaScript ES6. After reading the Road to learn React, you should possess all the basics required for proceeding with this book. It builds upon the React book perfectly.

### Editor and Terminal

What about the development environment? You will need a running editor or IDE and terminal (command line tool). You can [follow my setup guide](https://www.robinwieruch.de/developer-setup/). It is adjusted for MacOS users, but you can find a Windows setup guide for React too. In general, there is a ton of articles out there that will show you how to set-up a web development environment in a more elaborated way for your OS.

Optionally, you can use git and GitHub on your own, while conducting the exercises in the book, to keep your projects and the progress in repositories on GitHub. There exists a [little guide](https://www.robinwieruch.de/git-essential-commands/) on how to use these tools. But once again, it is not mandatory for this book and can be overwhelming when learning everything from scratch. So you can skip it if you are a newcomer in web development to focus on the essential parts taught in this book.

### Node and NPM

Last but not least, you will need an installation of [node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/). Both are used to manage libraries you will need along the way. In this book, you will install external node packages via npm (node package manager). These node packages can be libraries or whole frameworks.

You can verify your versions of node and npm on the command line. If you don't get any output in the terminal, you need to install node and npm first. These are the available stable versions during this book write-up:

{title="Command Line",lang="text"}
~~~~~~~~
node --version
*v8.9.4
npm --version
*v6.1.0
~~~~~~~~

If you've read the Road to learn React, you should be familiar with the setup already. The book gives you a short introduction to the npm ecosystem using the command line. So, if you are not familiar with this, once again you can pick up the Road to learn React book.
