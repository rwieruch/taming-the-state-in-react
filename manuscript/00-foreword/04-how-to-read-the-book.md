## How to read the Book

One thing is certain; no one learned to program by just reading a book. Programming is about practicing and conquering challenges to strengthen your skills as a developer. No one learned a programming paradigm such as functional programming or object-oriented programming in the short term. No one learned a concept, such as state management in modern web applications overnight. No one learned libraries such as React or Express over one night. You will learn things only by deliberately practicing them.

In this book, I want you to actively participate in solving different challenges and get hands-on experiences to improve your skills. The challenges are meant to create a flow experience, a scenario where the challenge meets your skills and tools at hand. Otherwise, you would feel either overwhelmed or bored. If the book can keep this balance of challenging you and respecting your level of skills, you might experience a [state of flow](https://www.robinwieruch.de/lessons-learned-deep-work-flow/). Personally, I found this insight astonishing when I read about myself, so I hope that I can induce it in this book. It would be the perfect learning experience.

### Tips & Tricks

The [JS BIN](http://jsbin.com/) is an online editor that you'll use occasionally. It may not always provide all functionalities from modern browsers. For instance, you might run into problems when trying to apply functionalities for JavaScript ES6 and beyond. That's why the book attempts to transition to project in your editor as soon as possible. There, you have full control over your projects and can continue working on the projects even after reading the book.

In this book, you will be guided to solve problems by using the techniques you have learned in previous chapters. You will solve these problems in an online editor or your editor. It should give you the experience of applying your learnings beyond only reading a book. This book aims to go beyond just being reading material. It's supposed to be a practical hands-on guide that lets you apply your learnings to deepen your knowledge.

Besides, make sure to internalize each lesson learned before you continue with the next chapter. The book is written in a way that the learnings build upon each other. Your knowledge about the topics taught will not only scale horizontally by using different techniques but also vertically by deploying technique on technique. That's why it is important to internalize each learning before you continue to read.

Another hint is **making notes while you read the book**. You can write down questions where the book doesn't give you answers and look them up afterward. Or you can write down your learnings to internalize them. That is how I do it when I read a book. Last but not least, if you write down feedback about the book, you can send me your notes afterward. I am highly interested in improving the book every time to keep up the quality.

Moreover, I encourage you to **write the codes yourself**. Even though the book shows you the source code, don't copy and paste it, but try to write it yourself. It's only in this way that you will get a better understanding of it. When you encounter bugs during coding, you have to figure out yourself what went wrong to fix it. So it is encouraged to introduce bugs; otherwise, everything goes flawlessly when following only the instructions in the book, but you will not know how to come up with your solutions in the world out there after reading the book. Only this way you will improve your skills as a developer.

Last but not least, perhaps you can find time in between **tinkering with your applications for applying your recent learnings** from the book. It is the best way of learning new things in the programming world because without trying to learn by yourself, you will never master them. I highly recommend coming up with your own projects. If you have difficulties to come up with a project idea, check out this [article](https://www.robinwieruch.de/how-to-learn-framework/).

It should be obvious by now that you will have the best outcome of this book by having a laptop on your side. That way you can directly apply your new learnings in your editor/IDE and confront yourself with the challenges from the book. As mentioned before, no one learned something by just reading a book. You are in charge, make sure you get more than only white pages with black letters out of it. You will have to fill it with colors in-between.
